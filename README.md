## Project Description
> ~~A helper for communicating between BungeeCord and Bukkit, intended for developers' own servers and requires pre-deployment. Compared to PluginMessage, it may be easier to use, and most importantly, it can work without any proxy players.~~

Yeah, this was designed for my own use. I started planning to make a replacement tool as soon as I found out about the proxy player limit in PluginMessage, but I needed to transfer info between different servers to the bots on my social platforms anytime. That's why this tool is so rough — didn't want to bother with authentication, so I just stripped it down to only work on localhost.

Most likely, only our own servers will use it, but for convenience, I still uploaded the API part to CodeMC.
